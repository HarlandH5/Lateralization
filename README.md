# Lateralization
Simulation of cerebral lateralization by vocabulary aquisition

Cerebral lateralization gives people a favored hand, 
(more often the right hand, but many are left handed).
Lateralization also establishes a speech center in one
        hemisphere, usally the same hemisphere as handedness
        but not always. The mechanism is unknown.
    
Situs inversus, organs on the 'wrong' side, is a very
        rare condition, while left-handedness is quite common.
        This suggests theories that left-handedness is somehow
        developmental. A theory of minimal brain injury to the
        dominant hemisphere has been disproven.
        
The corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres with
        the longest, and so the slowest, axons in the cerebrum.
        This suggests a theory that lateralization optimizes
        the speed of thought, speech, and movement, by minimizing
        the use of the slower connections.
    
Lateralization.swift is a simulation to test how much
        initial bias is needed for a sequence of words learned
        in normal speech to concentrate in one hemisphere. The
        bias was set internally at 1% when it was found that 
        very little bias was, in fact, necessary.
    
To run Lateralization.swift, use a complete path to any
        large, plain text file, .txt, in any language.
